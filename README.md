1) Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.
DriverPass was the client. They wanted an easy to use website where students could sign up, study with practice tests, and book on the road lessons. Staff needed tools to manage schedules, students, and payments. It had to work well on phones and computers to keep people's information safe.

2) What did you do particularly well?
I turned the interview notes into a clear list of what the site must do for students and staff. I kept the design simple and focused on real tasks, like signing up, studying, booking, and tracking progress, so it would be easy to build and use.

3) If you could revise one part, what would it be and how?
I'd improve the rules around scheduling, cancellations, and refunds. I'd spell out more "what if" situations and give concrete examples so there's less confusion for users and the team building it.

4) How did you interpret the userâ€™s needs and put them into the design? Why does that matter?
I started with their main goal, help students pass their driving tests, and then listed the steps users actually take: study, book lessons, see progress, pay, and get help. I shaped the screens and flows around those steps. Focusing on user needs matters because it saves rework, makes the site easier to use, and ensures we're solving the right problems.

5) How do you approach designing software? What will you do in the future?
My approach is:
- Understand the goals and who will use it.
- Write a short, clear list of must-have features.
- Sketch simple flow diagrams to show how things work.
- Plan a straightforward setup that's safe, reliable, and can grow.
- Share early drafts, get feedback, and improve before anyone starts building.
